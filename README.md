# Hello!

This repository includes two folders with my pet works:

**all_home_works** - there is collected all my solutions for homeworks from all passed courses that relate to QA Automation via Python.

**Invest-Project** - there is my own project where I was practiced with OOP, classes, methods, etc.

**https://github.com/Ivan-Demianchuk-Ukraine/automation_project** - you can also navigate to this my repository to see the testing framework that I made via PyTest, Allure & SeleniumWebDriver.
